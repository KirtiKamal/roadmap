# Covenant of Community Commitment

## Introduction

The Covenant of Community Commitment is an eloquent expression of our collective dedication to creating an environment of unfaltering respect and boundless inclusivity within our vibrant community. This document serves as a testament to our unwavering commitment to cultivating a haven where all individuals can engage, contribute, and flourish, irrespective of their age, physique, apparent or concealed disabilities, ethnicity, gender, or any other distinguishing characteristic. Our pledge is to conduct ourselves in a manner that perpetually nurtures an atmosphere that is wide-open, diverse, and robustly welcoming.

## Our Solemn Oath

We solemnly pledge to fashion a sanctuary of impeccable comportment within our community, characterized by the following principled ideals:

- Exhibiting unbridled empathy and unfaltering kindness toward our fellow community members.
- Embracing a spirit of profound respect for the multiplicity of viewpoints, opinions, and life journeys that enrich our collective tapestry.
- Offering and receiving constructive feedback with grace and gratitude.
- Willingly accepting responsibility for any transgressions, humbly extending heartfelt apologies to those affected by our missteps, and relentlessly evolving through these experiences.
- Envisioning and actively pursuing the betterment of our community as a whole, elevating its collective spirit above personal interests.

## Prohibited Conduct

Within our harmonious community, certain behaviors are firmly disallowed:

- Employing any form of sexualized language or imagery, or attempting any amorous advances.
- Indulging in trolling, disparaging comments, personal or political attacks, or any other manifestations of disrespect.
- Partaking in any public or private acts of harassment.
- Sharing confidential information about others, whether it be physical addresses or email contacts, without explicit consent.
- Any other behavior that could be deemed inappropriate in a professional context.

## Guardians of Virtue

The sacred duty of clarifying and upholding the sacred tenets of this Covenant falls upon the venerable community leaders. They are entrusted with the noble authority to excise, amend, or decline comments, contributions, or other forms of input that deviate from the lofty ideals outlined herein. They shall elucidate the rationale underlying their moderation decisions when the situation warrants.

## Sphere of Influence

This Covenant of Community Commitment casts its protective embrace over every corner of our community's domains. Furthermore, it extends its protective shield to envelop any individual officially representing our community in public arenas. This can include instances where an individual wields an official email address, communicates through a designated social media account, or undertakes the mantle of an appointed representative at a virtual or in-person event.

## Enforcement Rituals

In cases where unseemly, harassing, or otherwise undesirable behavior manifests, the vigilant community leaders shall undertake the solemn task of enforcement. Such incidents shall be examined meticulously, with all due expedition and impartiality. It is incumbent upon our community leaders to safeguard the privacy and security of those who report such incidents.

## Hierarchy of Consequences

Our wise community leaders shall employ the following Hierarchy of Consequences when meting out penalties for actions in contravention of this Covenant:

### 1. Redemption

**Community Impact**: Employing inappropriate language or behavior considered unprofessional or unwelcome in our community.

**Consequence**: A confidential, written counsel from the community leaders, offering lucidity regarding the nature of the infraction and expounding upon the impropriety of the behavior. A request for a public act of contrition may be solicited.

### 2. Vigilance

**Community Impact**: A single instance of violation or a series of transgressions.

**Consequence**: A vigilant warning with repercussions for the continuation of the behavior. A mandated cessation of all interactions with the affected parties, including uninvited engagement with those enforcing this Covenant, for a specified duration. This proscription encompasses all interactions within our community spaces as well as external mediums like social media. Breaching these stipulations may result in a temporary or permanent exclusion.

### 3. Temporary Exile

**Community Impact**: A grave breach of our community's ethical standards, including persistent displays of inappropriate conduct.

**Consequence**: A temporary exile from all forms of interaction or public discourse within our community for a designated period. During this intermission, no form of public or private communication with the implicated parties is sanctioned, including unsolicited correspondence with those entrusted with upholding this Covenant. Violations of these terms may culminate in a permanent expulsion.

### 4. Eternal Banishment

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating an enduring pattern of defiance against our community's moral standards, including persistent inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or the manifestation of aggression or disparagement directed toward specific groups.

**Consequence**: An everlasting ban from all forms of public interaction within our cherished community.
